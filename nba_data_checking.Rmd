This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(pystr)
```


Check the number of games in season (82 in regular; 66 in 2011-2012)
```{r}

games <- read.csv("C:/Courses/NBA_python/espn-nba-scrapy/data/games.csv", header=T)
home_games <- games %>%  group_by_('HOME_TEAM', 'PLAY_SEASON') %>% summarise(HOME_GAMES =n())
visit_games <- games %>%  group_by_('VISIT_TEAM', 'PLAY_SEASON') %>% summarise(VISIT_GAMES =n())
colnames(home_games)[1] <- "TEAM"
colnames(visit_games)[1] <- "TEAM"
total_games <- merge(x = home_games, y = visit_games, by = c("TEAM", "PLAY_SEASON"), all = TRUE)
total_games$TOTAL_GAMES<- total_games$HOME_GAMES  + total_games$VISIT_GAMES
head(total_games)
```

compare between home and visit games (sould be equal)
one game boston vs indiana was canceled
```{r}
total_games %>% filter(HOME_GAMES != VISIT_GAMES)
```


Check that number of games points from games.csv and players.csv are equal - we got 3 rows out of 150000 that do not correspond

```{r}
players <- read.csv("C:/Courses/NBA_python/espn-nba-scrapy/data/players.csv", header=T)
p_points_per_game <- players %>% filter(pystr_isnumeric(as.character(PTS))) %>% mutate(PTS =  as.numeric(as.character(PTS))) %>% group_by_('GAME_ID', 'TEAM') %>% summarise(SCORE_FROM_PLAYERS=sum(PTS))

g_points_per_game1 <- games %>% select(GAME_ID, TEAM=HOME_TEAM, SCORE_FROM_GAMES=HOME_TEAM_SCORE) 
g_points_per_game2 <- games %>% select(GAME_ID, TEAM=VISIT_TEAM, SCORE_FROM_GAMES=VISIT_TEAM_SCORE) 
g_points_per_game <- rbind(g_points_per_game1, g_points_per_game2)

games_players_score_cmp <- merge(x = p_points_per_game, y = g_points_per_game, by = c("GAME_ID", "TEAM"), all = TRUE)
head(games_players_score_cmp)

games_players_score_cmp %>% filter(SCORE_FROM_PLAYERS != SCORE_FROM_GAMES)

```

```{r}

player_stats <- read.csv("C:/Courses/NBA_python/espn-nba-scrapy/data/player_stat.csv", header=T)

#get PLAY_SEASON, TEAM, NAME by joining players and games
season_players <- merge(x = games %>%select(GAME_ID, PLAY_SEASON), y=players %>%select(GAME_ID, TEAM, NAME, ID)) %>% group_by_('PLAY_SEASON', 'TEAM', 'NAME', 'ID') %>% summarise 

#merge with players_stats
players_stats_cmp <- merge(x = season_players, y = player_stats, by = c("TEAM", "PLAY_SEASON", "ID"), all = TRUE)

#overall players number
nrow(players_stats_cmp)


#number of players with PER
nrow(players_stats_cmp %>% filter(is.na(PER)))

#number of palyer without PER
nrow(players_stats_cmp %>% filter(!is.na(PER)))

#number of players without stats
nrow(players_stats_cmp %>% filter(is.na(GP)))

```
